      <description>Liveness probe is a mechanism used by orchestrator platforms, to determine which process has gone faulty and then usually attempts to restart it, how is dependent on the orchestrator.
The faults are very much dependent on the process code, determining faults is dependent on both process code and the orchestration engine, handling the faults is usually left to the orchestration engine to handle it. So, it definitely sounds like a very useful feature then in the first glance for any orchestrator where a particular kind of process is running in a large number and for a very long time.</description>

      <description>Productivity So you probably have a couple thousand and a half things to do and 99% of them should have been done by now, but you didn&amp;rsquo;t get enough time and that&amp;rsquo;s why you will start tomorrow fresh again on achieving these, where tomorrow is some mystical land where 99% of the human productivity lives. Do you see a common pattern over the years where you wanted to do a lot of things but weren&amp;rsquo;t able to?</description>

      <description>I heard you wanted a practical distributed systems, so here it is writing hello world of distributed systems - a distributed counter. For a little of background, let&amp;rsquo;s just say you are trying to write a likes service which tracks likes for a particular post and you want to horizontally scale this service by adding multiple instances of this service due to whatever reasons. So, let&amp;rsquo;s just talk about the ways to achieve this.</description>
